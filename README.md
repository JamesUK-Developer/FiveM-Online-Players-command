# FiveM-Online-Players-command
A very simple /pop command that shows how many players you have in your FiveM server online! 

To install just drag the "pop" folder in your resources folder, and make sure to start it in server.cfg or resources.cfg :)) 

Changing the command:
If you want to change the command, simply go to client/client.lua 
and change 'pop' to something else like 'playersonline'.
