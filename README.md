# FiveM-Online-Players-command
A very simple /pop command that shows how many players you have in your FiveM server online! 

To install just drag the "pop" folder to your resources folder, and make sure to start it in server.cfg or resources.cfg :)) 

There is loads of configuration in the Config.lua file inside of the client folder.
